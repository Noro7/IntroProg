Actually, I am not sure if I can write anything about the previous class because I have never participated in any. My bad. However, I can write here about one of my favourite books - Nausea. I experienced Nausea anytime facing the reality. Possibly, that is the reason why I didn't want to face any kind of reality (I found university classes to be a part of the reality). Can I blame my situation on the existential crisis I was experiencing? Maybe.
